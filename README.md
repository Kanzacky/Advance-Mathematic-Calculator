# PROJECT ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL CALCULATOR

## Advanced Mathematical Calculator
A professional-grade Python CLI tool for complex mathematical computation, moving beyond basic arithmetic into the realm of symbolic-style logic and data visualization.

### Main Functionality
This application serves as a terminal-based workstation for engineers, students, and developers. It bridges the gap between simple calculators and complex software like MATLAB by providing an interactive environment for solving calculus, statistics, and algebraic equations.

### Key Features
* **Intelligent Parsing:** Uses the Shunting Yard Algorithm to handle nested expressions and operator precedence.
* **Calculus Suite:** Numerical differentiation (Central Difference) and integration (Simpson's Rule).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Instant computation of Mean, Median, Variance, and Standard Deviation.
* **Equation Solver:** Handles quadratic equations with support for complex numbers.
* **Live Plotting:** Generates 2D function graphs using coordinate-based rendering.
* **Memory System:** Store results in variables and track calculation history.

### Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.7+
* **Computation:** NumPy (High-performance numerical processing).
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib (Graph rendering).
* **Logic Engine:** Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) & Regex-based Tokenization.
* **Architecture:** Modular Object-Oriented Design (OOP).
